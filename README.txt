main: runs the imffs program.
tests_mm: runs the multimap tests
imffs_tests: runs the tests for the imffs functions. (Note that I have included invalid cases here.
 Please run with -DNDEBUG to see the full automated testing).

The defragmention is implemented. It should work completely. I also documented it in detail.

Thank you!
